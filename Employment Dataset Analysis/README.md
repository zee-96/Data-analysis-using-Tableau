## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze raw employment and unemployment data, calculate crucial economic performance metrics, and visualize the key drivers of labor market change across different geographies and industrial sectors.

## 📈 Key Analysis & Visualizations

The dashboard utilizes the following four main charts to answer critical questions about the employment market:

1.  **Average % Change by City:**
    * **Purpose:** Measures the average rate of employment growth or decline over a specific period. This is essential for identifying which geographic areas are expanding or contracting economically.
    * **Insight:** Highlights high-growth/high-risk metropolitan areas, informing investment or policy decisions.
2.  **Employment by City:**
    * **Visualization:** A Map or Geospatial view showing the distribution of total employment across various cities.
    * **Insight:** Provides a clear spatial understanding of where the bulk of the workforce is concentrated.
3.  **Top 10 Industries:**
    * **Purpose:** Ranks the major industrial sectors based on total employment (or a similar key metric).
    * **Insight:** Identifies the primary economic pillars supporting the region, allowing for high-level resource allocation focus.
4.  **Top 10 Sub Industries:**
    * **Purpose:** Provides a granular ranking of sub-sectors (e.g., within Manufacturing or Retail).
    * **Insight:** Pinpoints specific, niche areas driving performance within the overall industry structure.
