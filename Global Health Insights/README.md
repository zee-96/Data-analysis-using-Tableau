## 🎯 Project Objective

To explore the correlations between regional factors (continent), demographic composition (gender), and critical health indicators (Life Expectancy and BMI) to identify significant global health disparities and trends.

## 📈 Key Analysis & Visualizations

The dashboard is structured around four critical charts designed to highlight specific health relationships:

1.  **Gender Life Expectancy:**
    * **Purpose:** Directly compares the average life expectancy for males versus females across selected regions or countries.
    * **Insight:** Clearly visualizes the **gender gap** in lifespan, a standard global health metric, and allows users to explore whether this gap is consistent globally.
2.  **Life Expectancy by Continent:**
    * **Visualization:** A comparison chart  aggregating life expectancy across different **continents**.
    * **Insight:** Provides a high-level **geographical segmentation**, identifying which continents lead in longevity and which face the greatest challenges.
3.  **Life Expectancy vs. BMI:**
    * **Visualization:** A **Scatter Plot** showing the relationship between a country's average Life Expectancy and its average Body Mass Index (BMI).
    * **Insight:** Reveals potential **correlations** between nutritional status/lifestyle indicators and overall longevity, prompting deeper exploration into public health factors.
4.  **Population by Gender:**
    * **Visualization:** A pie chart  showing the total **population distribution** between genders.
    * **Insight:** Establishes the demographic context for the other charts, ensuring metrics (like average life expectancy) are interpreted relative to the population size.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Showcased

This project highlights my ability to handle complex socio-economic data and create insightful visual models:

* **Geospatial and Categorical Filtering:** Utilizing interactive filters to allow users to select and focus on specific regions or population groups.
* **Clean Dashboard Design:** Structuring a multi-chart dashboard with clear labels and tooltips to ensure easy interpretation of sensitive health statistics.
